Our Mission

 We are on a mission to bridge Wall Street assets into the crypto markets.

















Our Story

After spending over a decade at some of the largest financial institutions, including Bank of America, American Express, and Goldman Sachs, and founding Bond Intelligence Inc., a startup specializing in blockchain, big data, and machine learning, Ajit became captivated by the potential of blockchain in finance and its potential to revolutionize the industry. He noticed a gap and observed that the mainstream finance sector lacked an understanding of blockchain and that its complexity was a significant barrier and a deal-breaker. This led to a collaborative project between Bond Intelligence Inc. and the CFRM (Computational Finance and Risk Management) program at the University of Washington, where Ajit served as a guest speaker and industry collaborator in the course    CFRM Class of 2019 (Computational Finance and Risk Management: 525 FinTech, Blockchains, and Cryptocurrencies) during the Winter of 2019. Here, he worked alongside Professor Tim Leung, Ph.D., the Boeing Endowed Chair Professor of Applied Mathematics and Director of the CFRM program at the University of Washington.
                                        Ajit, along with Dr. Tim Leung and a group of colleagues and friends from finance, technology, and academia, including John, Dipit, Victor, Abhishek, Barnet, Mike, Franky, Julius, and others, engaged in extensive brainstorming sessions. Their focus was on identifying the key obstacles that were preventing fund managers from participating in the crypto markets. They zeroed in on the lack of on-chain credit, operational infrastructure, and policies as major barriers to entry.
                                        The team's solution was the creation of an on-chain margin account with operational infrastructure to address the lack of on-chain credit, a critical aspect of the finance industry. With this in place, fund managers will be able to enter the crypto markets as soon as policies permit and clients request crypto investments in their portfolios. With the knowledge and means to participate in the crypto market, an on-chain margin account providing credit will be a game changer, acting as a catalyst for growth. This idea gave birth to OpenEXA, with the belief that an on-chain line of credit will be the driving force behind their success, just as jet fuel propels a rocket forward.
                                        After thorough market research and consultation with industry experts, as well as interviews with numerous fund managers, they realized the opportunity was far greater than they initially anticipated. As OpenEXA continues to take shape, more individuals are becoming a part of this movement, eager to contribute to its success.

Establishing Trust

OpenEXA is a team of skilled finance professionals, engineers, crypto developers, and data scientists dedicated to producing high-quality products. We subscribe to the belief that code is law and that data inspires trust, which is the bedrock of any productive engagement. We also recognize that trust is the currency of engagement, and we are committed to engineering smart contracts, blockchain data blocks, and AI-powered algorithmic risk and pricing to the highest standards. In our view, these elements, not marble office buildings on Wall Street, represent the future cornerstones of trust.



Simplicity


                                            Navigating the crypto market can be challenging for fund managers due to a complicated regulatory system, opaque financial institutions, and a messy infrastructure. Fund managers need on-chain credit, compliant alternatives, and operational infrastructure that aligns with their fiduciary duties and enables them to create unique products. Streamlining technology, simplifying it, and providing clear guidance throughout the onramp process is no easy feat. However, we firmly believe that by staying true to this objective, we can create an exceptional solution that helps fund managers unlock untapped Alpha.
